            <h1>Glitter Effect</h1>
            <p>
                Glitter compositions produce flashes of light. This is not to be
                confused with strobe effects, which also produce flashes of
                light, as glitter effects take place in the fire dust or trail
                of the firework rather than the burning material itself. It's
                most often used as a star trail effect but can also find uses in
                fountains, rocket tails, sparklers, etc.

                    Produces bright white flashes in the trail of its fire dust
                    with a short delay. Works great for stars but produces a lot
                    of dross which could clog a choked fountain or rocket. This
                    recipe came from "Glitter: Chemistry and Techniques" by
                    Lloyd Scott Oglesby.
