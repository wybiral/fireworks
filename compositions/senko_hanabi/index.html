            <p>
                These are a type of handheld sparkler that date back to at least
                the early 1900's in Japan. Older versions of them were closer in
                construction to modern western sparklers where a thin stick was
                coated in a composition and dried. These days they're more often
                constructed from a small amount of the composition powder
                tightly rolled in a strip of tissue paper with a long tail of
                paper functioning as the handle.

                The end of the tissue paper near the composition is lit and the
                flame quickly ignites all of the composition. Then a ball of
                molton slag forms on the end, believed to be composed of carbon
                particles trapped in potassium sulfide. As the slag bubbles tiny
                explosions erupt in all directions forming a quiet and elegant
                display of fractal branches of sparks.

                The composition of senko hanabi these days is a variant on the
                typical <a href="/fireworks/compositions/black_powder">black
                powder</a> formula but with a higher sulfur content. The
                increased sulfur facilitates the formation of the molton
                potassium sulfide slag that the sparks are emitted from.
                <ul>
                    <li>15 Potassium nitrate</li>
                    <li>4 Charcoal</li>
                    <li>6 Sulfur</li>
                </ul>
                In his book "Fireworks: The Art, Science, and Technique", Takeo
                Shimizu suggests that the optimal amount of the composition per
                sparkler is about 0.09 grams (90mg). This small lump of powder
                is rolled tighly in tissue paper with one end being twisted into
                a long tail to form a handle.
