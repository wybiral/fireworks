            <h1>Charcoal Stars</h1>
            <p>
                Charcoal-based stars are most frequently used for their "fire
                dust" effect, referring to the trail of golden orange charcoal
                embers they leave. The chrysanthemum firework effect is a good
                example of this, where each star creates a path of golden fire
                dust radiating from the central burst point and lingering in the
                sky for a moment. Metal additivies to charcoal stars are
                sometimes also used to create various glitter and firefly
                effects.
            </p>
            <p>
                All of the non-metal fire dust compositions should be wet at
                some point to ensure that the potassium nitrate is dissolved and
                absorbed into the charcoal particles and each ingredient should
                be finely powdered. This helps to maintain a longer burning
                spark that hangs in the sky. The choice of charcoal can
                influence this spark effect with some types of wood or lampblack
                creating a more delicate, but longer hanging spark, while other
                types of wood create larger bright sparks that don't last as
                long.

                <h2>Chrysanthemum 6</h2>
                <p>
                    This recipe creates short lived but bright burning fire dust
                    that works great for star trails. It can also be used as an
                    outer layer on other types of stars to give them a trail.
                </p>

                <h2>Chrysanthemum 8</h2>
                <p>
                    Similar to Chrysanthemum 6 but burns for longer although not
                    quite as bright. Also great for stars on its own or as an
                    outer coating for trails.
                </p>

                    <li>40% Charcoal</li>
                    <li>5% SGRS (or dextrin)</li>

                <h2>Chrysanthemum of Mystery</h2>
                <p>
                    Similar to Chrysanthemum 6 and 8 but even longer lasting and
                    much more subtle of a fire dust effect. Shimizu describes
                    this one as having a "lonely" feel to it. The ratio of
                    charcoal and absence of sulfur are responsible for the
                    softer lingering effect.
                </p>

                <h2>Willow</h2>
                <p>
                    This recipe produces very long lasting fire dust trails and
                    when used in stars the path lasts long enough to create a
                    visible drooping effect like willow branches. These
                    particles burn long enough that care should be taken in
                    planning their burst height and trajectory downward so that
                    they don't pose a fire risk.
                </p>

                <h2>Tiger Tail</h2>
                <p>
                    This recipe is most frequently used in comet fireworks where
                    a single large star is shot to create an effect similar to
                    a comet trail in the sky.
                </p>
