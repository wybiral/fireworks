            <h1>Sugar Stars</h1>
            <p>
                Here's a collection of firework star recipes using common sugar
                (sucrose) as the fuel source. This approach is impractical for
                commercial pyrotechnics due to being so sensitive to moisture
                and heat. But for homemade fireworks it has several advantages.
                It doubles as a binder and is water soluble so there's no need
                for noxious solvents. It's also widely available and cheap.

                None of these use any additional chlorine donors other than
                potassium perchlorate, which is also the main oxidizer. This
                means that the colors are all on the pale end of the spectrum
                but there are fewer ingredients required.

                These compositions can be moistened and formed into stars by
                either pressing or cutting. If you get the consistency right
                you can even roll them by hand. Be careful not to add too much
                water or it turns soupy fast. You want to add just enough for a
                damp sand consistency. It usually takes 2-4 days to fully dry
                depending on the humidity and size.

                Colors can be tuned using different sources and ratios of
                barium, copper, potassium, and strontium. These were just the
                supplies I had enough of on hand to experiment with. The
                addition of a strong chlorine donor should significantly
                increase the saturation for most of these colors.
            </p>

                One quirk of these colors is that strontium nitrate + copper
                oxychloride don't seem to mix in the flame the way I expected.
                They produced a reddish flame at the base with blue tips. The
                entire flame appears like a cold white from far away. This made
                it difficult to get a better violet/purple than potassium
                nitrate, which is quite pale itself and burns more aggressively.
