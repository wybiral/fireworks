            <h1>Black Powder</h1>
            <p>
                This is one of the most widely known and commonly used
                ingredients in fireworks, with written references dating all
                the back to 9th century China. The exact formula varies through
                the centuries and depending on the application but they mostly
                share the same basic ingredients:

                and <a href="../chemicals.html#sulfur">sulfur</a>.

                <h2>Standard Black Powder (15:3:2)</h2>
                <p>
                    When someone mentions "black powder" these days this is
                    usually the ratio they're referring to. Typically the
                    ingredients are finely ball milled together to create what
                    is known as "meal" but other forms are listed below.
                    <ul>
                        <li>15 Potassium nitrate</li>
                        <li>3 Charcoal</li>
                        <li>2 Sulfur</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <h3>Green Mix</h3>
                <p>
                    When all of these ingredients are combined in the correct
                    ratio, but not finely milled, it’s referred to as “green
                    mix”. This is a crude form that burns less cleanly or
                    efficiently but can be made into a good prime coat material
                    for certain types of stars.
                </p>
                <h3>Meal Powder</h3>
                <p>
                    When finely milled together this composition is usually
                    called “meal” or "meal powder". In this form it’s commonly
                    used as a base in many other compositions and as the
                    starting point for granulated or corned black powder. It can
                    also be used to coat rice hulls for burst charges.
                </p>
                <h3>Granulated Black Powder</h3>
                <p>
                    To granulate black powder you mix meal with a small quantity
                    of binder (usually dextrin, but SGRS works too) between
                    2%-5%. This mixture is slightly moistened and grated through
                    a screen to form small granules and then dried. This
                    significantly increases the burn rate and efficiency of the
                    powder and is commonly used as “lift” powder (for launching
                    shells into the air) or “burst” charge to explode small
                    shells.
                </p>
                <h3>Corned Black Powder</h3>
                <p>
                    Meal powder is moistened, pressed into dense cakes, dried,
                    and then broken up into small jagged granules. These
                    granules are then screened into different sizes. In this
                    form the burn rate is greatly improved over meal powder and
                    it’s easier to handle (less dust). Similar uses as
                    granulated black powder.

                <h2>Propellant (6:3:1)</h2>
                <p>
                    Slower than the common 15:3:2 mix but makes for a more
                    stable rocket propellant.
                    <ul>
                        <li>6 Potassium nitrate</li>
                        <li>3 Charcoal</li>

                <h2>Senko Hanabi (15:4:6)</h2>
                <p>
                    This mixture is used to create the "senko hanabi"
                    Japanese-style sparklers. The increased sulfur content
                    facilitates the formation of the molton potassium sulfide
                    slag that the sparks are emitted from. Shimizu suggests
                    90mg of this composition per sparkler.

                        <li>15 Potassium nitrate</li>
                        <li>4 Charcoal</li>
                        <li>6 Sulfur</li>
