            <h2 id="fuels">Fuels</h2>
            <h3 id="metals">Metals</h3>
            <h4 id="aluminum">Aluminum (Al)</h4>
            <p>
                The most frequently used metal fuel. Bright white high
                temperature flame. Can interfere with colors. Often used in
                combination with boric acid to inhibit spontaneous reaction with
                nitrates. Commonly used in flash powder composition.
            </p>
            <p>
                Comes in many different forms that all exhibit different
                properties in pyrotechnic compositions.
            </p>
            <h5 id="dark_aluminum">Dark Aluminum</h5>
            <p>
                Considered the best form of aluminum as a fuel source. Used in
                flash powder, thermite, stars, sparklers, etc.
            </p>
            <h5 id="flake_aluminum">Flake aluminum</h5>
            <p>
                Comes in a variety of mesh sizes from fine powder to large
                flakes and is typically used for effects like firefly and for
                bright white sparks.
            </p>
            <h5 id="spherical_aluminum">Spherical aluminum</h5>
            <p>
                Used for glitter effects and small white sparks. Not as reactive
                and almost entirely useless for flash powder.
            </p>
            <h4 id="magnesium">Magnesium (Mg)</h4>
            <p>
                Brighter and higher temperature than aluminum but also more
                sensitive, risking spontaneous combustion.
            </p>
            <h4 id="iron">Iron (Fe)</h4>
            <p>
                Produces bright gold sparks.
            </p>
            <h4 id="steel">Steel (Fe + C)</h4>
            <p>
                Produces branching gold sparks.
            </p>
            <h4 id="titanium">Titanium (Ti)</h4>
            <p>
                Produces bright white sparks. Coarse grinds can produce
                branching white sparks.
            </p>
            <h3 id="carbons">Carbons</h3>
            <h4 id="charcoal">Charcoal</h4>
            <p>
                Produces delicate gold sparks. Primary source of fuel in
                <a href="/fireworks/compositions/black_powder">black powder</a>
                compositions.
            </p>
            <h4 id="soft_wood_charcoal">Soft Wood Charcoal</h4>
            <p>
                Good for black powder and other fast burning compositions.
                Produces finer wispy sparks.
            </p>
            <h4 id="hard_wood_charcoal">Hard Wood Charcoal</h4>
            <p>
                Good for compositions that produce spark effects like fountains,
                rocket tails, and stars. It can be used to make black powder as
                well but is generally considered to be less efficient than soft
                wood charcoal for that purpose.
            </p>
            <h4 id="lamp_black">Lamp black</h4>
            <p>
                Used similarly to soft wood charcoal. Produces fine gold spark
                dust that lingers.
            </p>
            <h3 id="sugars">Sugars</h3>
            <h4 id="lactose">Lactose</h4>
            <p>
                Frequently used in smoke compositions.
            </p>
            <h4 id="dextrose">Dextrose</h4>
            <p>
                Used in some amateur rocket compositions.
            </p>
            <h4 id="sorbitol">Sorbitol</h4>
            <p>
                Used in some amateur rocket compositions.
            </p>
            <h4 id="sucrose">Sucrose</h4>
            <p>
                Common table sugar. Used in amateur rocket and smoke
                compositions. Can also be used to make
                <a href="/fireworks/compositions/stars/sugar">sugar stars</a>.
            </p>
            <h3 id="resins">Resins</h3>
            <h4 id="shellac">Shellac</h4>
            <p>
                Doubles as a binder and a fuel source. Not water soluble,
                requiring the use of either pure alcohol or acetone. Considered
                to be one of the best fuel/binders for color compositions.
            </p>
            <h4 id="red_gum">Red gum</h4>
            <p>
                Burns faster than <a href="#shellac">shellac</a> but is
                otherwise a common replacement in modern compositions.
            </p>
            <h3 id="sulfur">Sulfur (S)</h3>
            <p>
                Used as a fuel additive to speed up other reactions and make
                compositions more sensitive to ignition. A main ingredient in
                <a href="/fireworks/compositions/black_powder">black powder</a>.
            </p>
            <h2 id="oxidizers">Oxidizers</h2>
            <h3 id="nitrates">Nitrates</h3>
            <h4 id="potassium_nitrate">Potassium nitrate (KNO3)</h4>
            <p>
                Common oxidizer used in
                <a href="/fireworks/compositions/black_powder">black powder</a> and other
                pyrotechnic compositions. Fairly stable and works best in high
                temperature mixes (like those with charcoal and sulfur or
                metals). Not as efficient in low temperature mixes (like with
                shellac).
            </p>
            <h4 id="strontium_nitrate">Strontium nitrate (Sr[NO3]2)</h4>
            <p>
                As an oxidizer it works best at high temperatures but it also
                doubles as a source of color. Even without a chlorine donor,
                burning strontium nitrate will produce a bright red flame. With
                chlorine you can get a much deeper shade.
            </p>
            <h4 id="barium_nitrate">Barium nitrate (Ba[NO3]2)</h4>
            <p>
                Another nitrate oxidizer that doubles as a source of color.
                Commonly used for green flames (along with a chlorine donor) or
                white (in the absence of chlorine). When used with aluminum it
                is strongly advised to add boric acid prevent decomposition.
            </p>
            <p>
                Toxic if ingested even in small quantities. Handle with caution.
            </p>
            <h4 id="sodium_nitrate">Sodium nitrate (NaNO3)</h4>
            <p>
                Produces a yellow flame with good illumination. Best in high
                temperature compositions.
            </p>
            <h3 id="potassium_perchlorate">Potassium perchlorate (KClO4)</h3>
            <p>
                Common and relatively stable oxidizer used in a wide range of
                compositions. A much safer replacement for
                <a href="#potassium_chlorate">potassium chlorate</a>.
            </p>
            <h3 id="potassium_chlorate">Potassium chlorate (KClO3)</h3>
            <p>
                This chemical isn’t recommended for amateur use. Extremely
                reactive and less stable than <a href="#potassium_perchlorate">
                potassium perchlorate</a>. Should not be used in compositions
                with sulfur due to high impact and friction sensitivity. Also
                potentially dangerous when mixed with ammonium salts (produces
                ammonium chlorate).
            </p>
            <h2 id="binders">Binders</h2>
            <h3 id="dextrin">Dextrin</h3>
            <p>
                This is the most common binder for amateur fireworks in the U.S.
                and it works as a binder, a fuel source, and to slow the rate of
                combustion.
            </p>
            <h3 id="sgrs">SGRS</h3>
            <p>
                Soluble Glutinous Rice Starch is a common binder in Japanese
                fireworks that’s used almost exactly like
                <a href="#dextrin">dextrin</a> but is a more efficient binder,
                allowing for less to be used in the composition while still
                producing hard stars. It’s best to use the least amount of
                moisture possible since SGRS can be slow to dry and will droop
                before setting up if too much water is used.

            <h3 id="blue">Copper (blue)</h3>
            <h4>Copper Oxychloride</h4>
            <p>
                In the presence of a chlorine donor, adding copper oxychloride
                to a composition will produce a deep blue flame. Without
                chlorine it can produce more pale green shades.
            </p>
            <h2 id="chlorine_donors">Chlorine donors</h2>
            <p>
                For more vibrant colors a source of free chlorine in the flame
                is required so compositions often add something known as a
                "chlorine donor". <a href="#potassium_chlorate">Potassium
                chlorate</a> works as a donor to an extent, and
                <a href="#potassium_perchlorate">potassium perchlorate</a> to an
                even lesser extent, but with both of these color production is
                usually more pastel. For deep vibrant colors you'll need a
                source of chlorine.
            </p>
            <h3 id="parlon">Parlon</h3>
            <p>
                This chlorinated rubber is one of the best chlorine donors and
                it can also function as a binder for stars. Not commonly
                available outside of pyrotechnic chemical suppliers.
            </p>
            <h3 id="pvc">PVC</h3>
            <p>
                The shorthand for polyvinyl chloride, which is a plastic polymer
                that can be used as a chlorine donor and to some extent a fuel.
                Not as effective as <a href="#parlon">parlon</a> but much more
                widely available.
