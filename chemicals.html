            <h1>Chemicals</h1>
            <h2>Fuels</h2>
            <h3>Metals</h3>
            <h4>Aluminum (Al)</h4>
            <p>
                The most frequently used metal fuel. Bright white high
                temperature flame. Can interfere with colors. Often used in
                combination with boric acid to inhibit spontaneous reaction with
                nitrates. Commonly used in flash powder composition.
            </p>
            <p>
                Comes in many different forms that all exhibit different
                properties in pyrotechnic compositions.
            </p>
            <h5>Dark Aluminum</h5>
            <p>
                Considered the best form of aluminum as a fuel source. Used in
                flash powder, thermite, stars, sparklers, etc.
            </p>
            <h5>Flake aluminum</h5>
            <p>
                Comes in a variety of mesh sizes from fine powder to large
                flakes and is typically used for effects like firefly and for
                bright white sparks.
            </p>
            <h5>Spherical aluminum</h5>
            <p>
                Used for glitter effects and small white sparks. Not as reactive
                and almost entirely useless for flash powder.
            </p>
            <h4>Magnesium (Mg)</h4>
            <p>
                Brighter and higher temperature than aluminum but also more
                sensitive, risking spontaneous combustion.
            </p>
            <h4>Iron (Fe)</h4>
            <p>
                Produces bright gold sparks.
            </p>
            <h4>Steel (Fe + C)</h4>
            <p>
                Produces branching gold sparks.
            </p>
            <h4>Titanium (Ti)</h4>
            <p>
                Produces bright white sparks. Coarse grinds can produce
                branching white sparks.
            </p>
            <h3>Carbons</h3>
            <h4>Charcoal</h4>
            <p>
                Produces delicate gold sparks. Primary source of fuel in
                <a href="comps/black_powder.html">black powder</a> compositions.
            </p>
            <h4>Soft Wood</h4>
            <p>
                Good for black powder.
            </p>
            <h4>Hard Wood</h4>
            <p>
                Good sparks.
            </p>
            <h4>Lamp black</h4>
            <p>
                Used similarly to charcoal. Produces fine gold spark dust that
                lingers.
            </p>
            <h3>Sugars</h3>
            <h4>Lactose</h4>
            <p>
                Frequently used in smoke compositions.
            </p>
            <h4>Dextrose</h4>
            <p>
                Used in amateur rocket compositions.
            </p>
            <h4>Sorbitol</h4>
            <p>
                Used in amateur rocket compositions.
            </p>
            <h4>Sucrose</h4>
            <p>
                Common table sugar. Used in amateur rocket and smoke
                compositions. Can also be used to make
                <a href="comps/sugar_stars.html">sugar stars</a>.
            </p>
            <h3>Resins</h3>
            <h4>Shellac</h4>
            <p>
                Doubles as a binder. Recommended for colored flame compositions.
            </p>
            <h4>Red gum</h4>
            <p>
                Burns faster than shellac but is otherwise a common replacement
                in modern compositions.
            </p>
            <h3>Sulfur (S)</h3>
            <p>
                Used as a fuel additive to speed up other reactions and make
                compositions more sensitive to ignition. A main ingredient in
                <a href="comps/black_powder.html">black powder</a>.
            </p>
            <h2>Oxidizers</h2>
            <h3>Nitrates</h3>
            <h4>Potassium nitrate (KNO3)</h4>
            <p>
                Common oxidizer used in
                <a href="comps/black_powder.html">black powder</a> and other
                pyrotechnic compositions. Fairly stable and works best in high
                temperature mixes (like those with charcoal and sulfur or
                metals). Not as efficient in low temperature mixes (like with
                shellac).
            </p>
            <h4>Strontium nitrate (Sr[NO3]2)</h4>
            <p>
                Commonly used in red flame compositions. Works best at high
                temperatures.
            </p>
            <h4>Barium nitrate (Ba[NO3]2)</h4>
            <p>
                Commonly used in green (along with a chlorine donor) or white
                flame (in the absence of chlorine) compositions. When used with
                aluminum boric acid is strongly advised to prevent
                decomposition.
            </p>
            <p>
                Toxic if ingested even in small quantities. Handle with caution.
            </p>
            <h4>Sodium nitrate (NaNO3)</h4>
            <p>
                Produces a yellow flame with good illumination. Best in high
                temperature compositions.
            </p>
            <h3>Potassium perchlorate (KClO4)</h3>
            <p>
                Common and relatively stable oxidizer used in a wide range of
                compositions. A much safer replacement for potassium chlorate.
            </p>
            <h3>Potassium chlorate (KClO3)</h3>
            <p>
                This chemical isn’t recommended for amateur use. Extremely
                reactive and less stable than perchlorate. Should not be used in
                compositions with sulfur due to high impact and friction
                sensitivity. Also potentially dangerous when mixed with ammonium
                salts (produces ammonium chlorate).
            </p>
            <h2>Binders</h2>
            <h3>Dextrin</h3>
            <p>
                This is the most common binder for amateur fireworks in the U.S.
                and it works as a binder, a fuel source, and to slow the rate of
                combustion.
            </p>
            <h3>SGRS</h3>
            <p>
                Soluble Glutinous Rice Starch is a common binder in Japanese
                fireworks that’s used almost exactly like dextrin but is a more
                efficient binder, allowing for less to be used in the
                composition while still producing hard stars. It’s best to use
                the least amount of moisture possible since SGRS can be slow to
                dry and will droop before setting up if too much water is used.
            </p>
            <h3>Shellac</h3>
            <p>
                Much like dextrin and SGRS, shellac functions as a binder and a
                fuel but is not water soluble, requiring the use of either
                pure alcohol or acetone. Considered to be one of the best
                fuel/binders for color compositions.
            </p>
            <h3>Red gum</h3>
            <p>
                Used almost exactly like shellac and has come to replace shellac
                in many modern firework compositions.
            </p>
            <h2>Colorants</h2>
            <h3>Strontium (red)</h3>
            <h4>Strontium Nitrate</h4>
            <p>
                Even without a chlorine donor, burning strontium nitrate will
                produce a bright red flame. With chlorine you can get a much
                deeper shade. Can be used as a nitrate oxidizer but doesn’t seem
                as efficient as potassium nitrate.
            </p>
            <h3>Calcium (orange)</h3>
            <h3>Sodium (yellow)</h3>
            <h3>Barium (green)</h3>
            <h4>Barium Nitrate</h4>
            <p>
                In the presence of a chlorine donor, burning barium nitrate will
                produce brilliant green light. Without chlorine it’s closer to
                the white end of the spectrum. Can be used as a nitrate oxidizer
                similar to potassium nitrate.
            </p>
            <p>
                Toxic if ingested even in small quantities. Handle with caution.
            </p>
            <h3>Copper (blue)</h3>
            <h4>Copper Oxychloride</h4>
            <p>
                In the presence of a chlorine donor, adding copper oxychloride
                to a composition will produce a deep blue flame. Without
                chlorine it can produce more pale green shades.
            </p>
